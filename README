ExtUtils::embed - Utilities for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications

This library is free software; 
you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself. 

ExtUtils::embed provides utility functions for embedding a Perl interpreter
and extensions in your C/C++ applications.  

Typically, an application Makefile will invoke ExtUtils::embed
functions while building your application.  

v, 1.04, June 17, 1996

o Added perl_inc, ccflags, ccdlflags and ccopts functions

o Added eg/ directory with examples from the perlembed manpage

v, 1.03, June 10, 1996

o Changed name from Devel::embed to ExtUtils::embed

v,1.02, May 6, 1996

o we now use MakeMaker's catdir()

o if $] > 5.002 we add the dXSUB_SYS macro to the body of xs_init

o added a copy of minimod.PL that uses Devel::embed,
  incase someone else would like to see them share

o added 'extralibs.ld' to ldopts() if found

o dropped extra curlies around newXS()'s

o changed the env pointer in t/embed.c's perl_parse() to NULL
As Tim Bunce pointed out:
A NULL means 'use the current environment'.

Passing an explicit env pointer will core dump if it becomes out of date
before it's used (e.g. a new env var is defined). The perl -d:foo mechanism
will define a new env var.

o updated documentation a bit

v,1.01, April 3, 1996

o Same as 1.00, but without test build junk on the tape

v,1.00, April 1, 1996

o Initial version

INSTALLING:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install (If all tests pass)
