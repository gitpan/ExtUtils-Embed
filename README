ExtUtils::Embed - Utilities for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications

This library is free software; 
you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself. 

ExtUtils::Embed provides utility functions for embedding a Perl interpreter
and extensions in your C/C++ applications.  

Typically, an application Makefile will invoke ExtUtils::Embed
functions while building your application.  

As of Perl version 5.003_01, the ExtUtils::Embed module is part of the 
standard distribution, but this package is maintained as a kit with tests
and examples that are not included with the Perl distribution.

INSTALLING:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install (If all tests pass)
