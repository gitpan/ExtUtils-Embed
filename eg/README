This directory contains examples from the perlembed manpage.
Simply type "perl build cfile"
Where "cfile" is the name of any *.c file in this directory.
This script runs the same command used in the perlembed manpage examples.

You may also wish to build with "perl ../genmake cfile; make" for linking
the xs_init function.
