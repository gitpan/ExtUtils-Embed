This directory contains examples from the perlembed manpage.
Simply type "perl build cfile"
Where "cfile" is the name of any *.c file in this directory.
This script runs the same command used in the perlembed manpage examples.

You may also wish to build with "perl ../genmake cfile; make" for linking
the xs_init function.

Examples in this directory include:
Jon Orwant's from the perlembed manpage:
interp.c
match.c
power.c
showtime.c
string.c

A few of mine from the December issue of The Perl Journal:
uri-url.c
regex.c

If you have any you'd like to add, let me <dougm@osf.org> know.

Happy embedding,
