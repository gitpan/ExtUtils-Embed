This directory contains examples from the perlembed manpage.
Simply type "build cfile"
Where "cfile" is the name of any *.c file in this directory, minus the ".c"
This shell script runs the same command used in the perlembed manpage examples.

You may also wish to build with "perl ../genmake.pl cfile; make" for linking the 
xs_init function.
