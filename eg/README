Simply type "perl build cfile"
Where "cfile" is the name of any *.c file in this directory.
This script runs the same command used in the perlembed manpage examples.

To build everything type "perl buildall"

To clean up type "perl cleanall"

There's no Makefile on purpose, that's left as an exercise or something.

You may also wish to build with "perl ../genmake cfile; make" for linking
the xs_init function.

Examples in this directory include:
Jon Orwant's from the perlembed manpage:
interp.c
match.c
power.c
showtime.c
string.c

Some of mine from the perlembed manpage:
persistent.c
multiplicity.c

A few of mine from the December issue of The Perl Journal:
uri-url.c
regex.c
