  bug with NeXT systems

v, 1.05, July 2, 1996

o Object for accessing MakeMaker methods now blessed into 'MY' class to avoid warnings

v, 1.04, June 17, 1996

o Added perl_inc, ccflags, ccdlflags and ccopts functions

o Added eg/ directory with examples from the perlembed manpage

v, 1.03, June 10, 1996

v,1.02, May 6, 1996

o we now use MakeMaker's catdir()

o if $] > 5.002 we add the dXSUB_SYS macro to the body of xs_init

o added a copy of minimod.PL that uses Devel::embed,
  incase someone else would like to see them share

o added 'extralibs.ld' to ldopts() if found

o dropped extra curlies around newXS()'s

o changed the env pointer in t/embed.c's perl_parse() to NULL
As Tim Bunce pointed out:
A NULL means 'use the current environment'.

Passing an explicit env pointer will core dump if it becomes out of date
before it's used (e.g. a new env var is defined). The perl -d:foo mechanism
will define a new env var.

o updated documentation a bit

v,1.01, April 3, 1996

o Same as 1.00, but without test build junk on the tape

v,1.00, April 1, 1996
