o changed the env pointer in t/embed.c's perl_parse() to NULL
As Tim Bunce pointed out:
A NULL means 'use the current environment'.

Passing an explicit env pointer will core dump if it becomes out of date
before it's used (e.g. a new env var is defined). The perl -d:foo mechanism
will define a new env var.
